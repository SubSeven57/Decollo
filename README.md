DecolloX
============

Decollo is a python toll for Ubuntu. This program install some programs I deem "necessary" for most Ubuntu set ups.

This current version is going a major rewrite. Expect a lot of issues.

Programs/Scripts
================
TBD

Warnings/Notes
==============

This is still very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.
