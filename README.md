Decollo v1.3
============

Decollo is a python program for Ubuntu. This program helps install some programs and themes that I find "necessary" for my Ubuntu setup. I am writing this script from scratch and this will be the basis for the future GUI version of Decollo. In other words, this is still a work in progress.

Instructions
============

- Unzip the .zip file

- Open terminal and navigate to unzipped folder (i.e. cd ~/Downloads/Decollo-master)

- In terminal type:

	$ python decollo

- Follow instructions

- ?

- Profit

Warnings/Notes
==============

This is still very much a work in progress. Use at your own risk.
